With this mod you can beef stuff up.

- !swap us - Swap to other US team
- !swap ru - Swap to other RU team
- !balance - detects team and swaps u to the other team
- !kickme  - Kicks your self

- !killme  - Kills your self (Advanced or Kinky style, see config.lua)
- Advanced: Default 5 !killme commands
- Want more, change killme_users[player.name] = 5 lines to the value you grant player the !killme command.

- Kinky: Default 3 !killme commands, howeverrrrrrr........
- For every 3 kills you make, you got granted 1 extra !killme command, with a max of 6 total (defaulted)
.
- u can adapt the following lines, s_killme_counter, s_killmestack_counter
- s_killme_counter is the new default value on spawn a player can use the !killme command.
- s_killmestack_counter is the new default value on the max !killme commands a player can use.
- depending on gamemode u play, u can adapt s_addup_counter, default 4 (kills need 3)
- if you change this, this is the ammount on kills a player need to get 1 more !killme command
.
- s_message_counter , default 3, when the limit is reached, the player got 2 messages saying that
- the !killme limit is reached.
.
- Balance: Balancing your self to the other team was never that fun.

- on disconect the values are reset back to default again (or on roundover)
